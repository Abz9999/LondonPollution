🌆 London Air Pollution Visualizer

A JavaFX desktop application that visualizes air pollution data for London between 2018–2023, based on public datasets from DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs).

The program displays trends for three major pollutants — Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), PM₁₀, and PM₂.₅ — through an interactive graphical user interface.
Users can explore pollution levels by year and pollutant type to gain insight into London’s air quality changes over time.
